<h1>Green Valley Operations Guide</h1>

<h2>Operating Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Runway Use:</strong> Operations may use either runway direction (17/35) depending on wind and conditions. Southbound launches are preferred due to safer emergency landing options. Final decision is at the discretion of the tow pilot and CFI given the wind and conditions. Note: in calm conditions it is possible to launch to the south and land to the north, makeing ops more efficient.</li>
  <li><strong>Patterns:</strong> Individually, tow planes use a pattern west of the field and gliders to the east as at AWO. This is for conflict avoidance and noise abatement. On tow, avoid overflying developments just to the east of the airport. Fly up river towards Jordan ridge.</li>
  <li><strong>Road Crossing:</strong> Place a cone and caution tape across the access road during launches and landings. Monitor for traffic if personnel are available.</li>
  <li><strong>Staging:</strong> Gliders stage at either end to the side of the runway. Staging areas have been mowed.
  <li><strong>Safety Briefings:</strong> Held before flight operations begin. Includes launch/landing direction, rope breaks, ground ops, and safety protocols.</li>
  <li><strong>Ground Safety:</strong> Avoid leaving vehicles or equipment or walking on the runway. Push gliders off the strip promptly after landing as needed, depending on sequencing.</li>
  <li><strong>Obstacles:</strong> North end has trees and a fenceline near the tree nursery. South end has power lines and a cherry tree. See diagram: <a href="WA25_Details_Apr-2025.jpg" target="_blank">WA25 Field Details</a></li>
  <li><strong>Windsocks:</strong> One located mid-field; a second is planned for the north end.</li>
  <li><strong>Runway Surface:</strong> Generally usable. Some unevenness noted on taxi but smooth enough for operations. Expect additional surface rolling in fall.</li>
  <li><strong>Grass Height:</strong> Must be kept short on either side of runway. Field has been widened and mowed after initial July ops.</li>
  <li><strong>Flight Eligibility:</strong> Solo flights are allowed at CFI discretion. Students and pilots flying club ships require checkout per <a href="https://evergreensoaring.info/content/current-bylaws" target="_blank">club bylaws</a> (section 3.2.9).</li>
  <li><strong>Field Use Authorization:</strong> Ongoing through summer; coordinated by Matt Rasmussen with the property manager. See Signup Genius for scheduled days.</li>
  <li><strong>Hangar Access:</strong> Hangar door code will be made available to FM before ops. Coordinate with FM or Matt for details. Do not share the code publicly as we are guests at this property. Currently we are storing the following in the hanger: golf cart, batteries, binders, as well as the L-33 (rigged), Grob and DG300 (in trailers). Restrooms are also available inside.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Sequence of Events (Typical Operation)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>FM and ground crew arrive early to inspect field, set up.</li>
  <li>Prep glider(s) as usual</li>
  <li>Mark the mid-field access road with caution tape (in the golf cart) and a cone.</li>
  <li>Safety briefing. Discuss direction of launch/landing in addition to the usual briefing topics.</li>
  <li>Stage gliders. Note the mowed areas at either end of the runway. There is room for staging both tow planes and at least one glider off the runway.</li>
  <li>Optionally, set up pop-up canopy and lawn chairs near staging, off runway. These are in the hanger.</li>
  <li>Conduct launches and landings, taking special care to pay attention to sequencing of the tow plane and glider(s) landings. Push/taxi off as soon as possible. If circumstances require, landing long or short to avoid conflict. Runway 12/30 is also available as an option, provided it has been mowed sufficiently wide enough to safely land a glider. Note that there are power lines to the east of 17/35 between the airfield and the brown house. They terminate before the south end of 12/30, just be aware of them. The airport owners plan to install line balls.</li> 
  <li>At the conclusion of ops, tie-down and put away gear as usual. Note that some coordination may be required between the tow pilot and FM regarding sending the tow cards in to bookkeeping.</li>
  <li>Make sure the hanger is locked and the area is tidy before you leave.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Atypical scenarios</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If relocating a glider from AWO (such as the second Blanik), determine who will fly. They, and a wing runner (FM or other), will need to show up at AWO early enough to prep and stage glider. This will be challenging as the golf cart is at GV.</li>
</ul>
